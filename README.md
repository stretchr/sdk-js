# Stretchr JavaScript SDK

Stretchr SDK for JavaScript and HTML5.

Rewrite in progress.

## Working on the SDK
If you want to contribute to the SDK, fork the repo and run `npm install` from the root project directory.

The project uses [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com).

Running `grunt` will run the tests and minify the source for production.

Running `grunt watch` will monitor files for changes and run the tests/minification process automatically as you code.
